# SecureIt
Complete Web Sceurity chrome extension

# Abstract
CSRF is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which he/she is currently authenticated. With a little help of social engineering (like sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may force the users of a web application to execute actions of the attacker's choosing. A successful CSRF exploit can compromise end user data and operation, when it targets a normal user. If the targeted end user is the administrator account, a CSRF attack can compromise the entire web application.

# CSRF relies on the following:
1. Web browser behavior regarding the handling of session-related information such as cookies and http authentication information
2. Knowledge by the attacker of valid web application URLs
3. Application session management relying only on information which is known by the browser
4. Existence of HTML tags whose presence cause immediate access to an http[s] resource; for example the image tag

# About SecureIt
It is extension to the hacktab security tests chrome extension for CSRF; deploying CSRF testing methods for checking whether a site is CSRF vulnerable or not. It will be helpful for developers, QA and Pen testers.

# Further work
There is a scope for AI algorithms in generalising and making web 2.0 (and ahead) secure.
